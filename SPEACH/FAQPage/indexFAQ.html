Speach is generally made by a few college students in Indonesia for a Human Computer and Interaction semester project. Our goal is to provide a free and engaging website for Speach users, especially to fulfills the customer’s needs, and give effective functionality whenever they use the site. In addition to that, We would also try to give a new approach on the design with a more ‘peach’ and ‘aesthetic’ theme rather than sticking the stereotype ‘modern’ and ‘simple’ style</p>
